# Exercises: Level 2

#1. Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function
print(type(first_name))
print(type(last_name))
print(type(full_name))
print(type(country))
print(type(City))
print(type(age))
print(type(year))
print(type(is_married))
print(type(is_true))
print(type(is_light_on))
print(type(higher_institution))
print(type(faculty))
print(type(department))
print(type(level))

# 1. Using the _len()_ built-in function, find the length of your first name
print(len(first_name))

# 1. Compare the length of your first name and your last name
print(len(first_name) == len(last_name))

# 1. Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two
num_one = 5
num_two = 4

# 1. Add num_one and num_two and assign the value to a variable total
total = num_one + num_two

# 1. Subtract num_two from num_one and assign the value to a variable diff
diff = num_one - num_two

# 1. Multiply num_two and num_one and assign the value to a variable product
product = num_two * num_one

# 1. Divide num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable division
division = num_one / num_two

# 1. Use modulus division to find num_two divided by num_one and assign the value to a variable remainder
remainder = num_two % num_one

# 1. Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
exp = num_one ** num_two

# 1. Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division
floor_division = num_one // num_two

#1. The radius of a circle is 30 meters.
    #1. Calculate the area of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of _area_of_circle_
radius = 30
_area_of_circle_ = 3.14 * radius ** 2

    #2. Calculate the circumference of a circle and assign the value to a variable name of _circum_of_circle_
radius = 30
_circum_of_circle_ = 2 * 3.14 * radius

    #3. Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
radius = input ("input radius here: ")
_area_of_circle_ = 3.14 * radius ** 2

# 1. Use the built-in input function to get first name, last name, country and age from a user and store the value to their corresponding variable names
first_name = input("Enter first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter last name: ")
country = input("Enter country: ")
age = input("Enter age here: ")

# 1. Run help('keywords') in Python shell or in your file to check for the Python reserved words or keywords
help('keywords')

'''Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.
